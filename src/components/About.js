        <p className="text-gray-300">
          I'm a self-taught programmer with a strong passion for building clean, interactive, and user-friendly web applications. My journey began with HTML and CSS, and quickly expanded into JavaScript, React, and Python as I started building real-world projects to sharpen my skills. 
          <br /><br />
          I thrive on solving problems, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into working software. Whether it's creating responsive UIs with React, scripting automation with Python, or working with APIs, I enjoy every part of the development process. I'm continuously learning and looking for opportunities to apply my skills in meaningful ways.
